```{r directive, include=FALSE}
# acquisition and management of large datasets as well as quality control. Your
# expertise in these topics is really beneficial to the group since we will be
# dedicating a considerable amount of time finding/curating datasets.  Would you
# be willing to share some techniques/best practices with the group during part
# of the webinar on Thursday 3/10? The idea is to provide some exposure to
# helpful approaches to data management as we move forward refining group
# research questions.

# Reproducible workflows
# Reproducible data access
# Reproducible modeling
```

```{r Greg_Wilson_notes, include=FALSE}
# productivity sells training
# scaring people w/ having to retract paper b/c of error doesn't sell
# skills: task automation (bash), tracking/sharing code (Git), re-use (scripting), data management (SQL)
```

## Upping your Analytical Game

### Efficiency 
- quickly write, revise, run, and revisit your code

### Transparency 
- let others see & understand what you're doing

### Reproducibility 
- enable anyone to run your analyses

```{r, include=FALSE}
# Reproducibility is the most stringent of of E,T,R, so we'll use that word to indicate all three
# Anything you do to implement one probably helps with the others
```

## Benefits

- implement each idea just once
- change data or methods freely
- handle more data & complexity
- run on clusters/cloud
- share with others
- share with your future self

```{r, include=FALSE}
# future self: paper revisions, check an analysis step, reuse code in a new project
```

## What makes work efficient, transparent, & reproducible?

### readable
- readable code
- traceable data flow

### uncorruptible
- automated data flow
- smart redundancy
- code versioning

### self-contained
- data to reports
- no local dependencies

```{r, include=FALSE}
# Reproducible Research - integrate your data, text, code, and results. this is
# sometimes but not always what you want, especially with modeling
```

## Readable code

- code comments
- meaningful variable names
- meaningful white space
- clarity via conciseness
- decomposition (modularity)
- don't repeat yourself (DRY)

## Traceable data flow

- an undocumented system is no system
- redundancy is great for data storage, awful for data analysis
- cache intermediate data products
- keep it acyclical
- expect your workflow to evolve

## Automated data flow

- use [`make`](http://www.gnu.org/software/make/)

## Reproducible data access

- know your data's provenance
- script your data access
  - `download.file()`
  - `httr::GET()`
  - [`geoknife`](https://github.com/USGS-R/geoknife)
  - [`dataRetrieval`](https://github.com/USGS-R/dataRetrieval)
  - [`dataone`](https://github.com/DataONEorg/rdataone), etc.
- cache a copy, but know it's fleeting

## Reproducible quality assessment

- even highly curated data have flaws
- check your n's - nrow, nunique
- check for outliers
- check for duplicates
- preserve 'raw' data
- script your corrections

## Scalable modeling

- separate the model from the model manager
- cache intermediate data
- create model run metadata; prefer tables, text, and png to pdf for quick review
- store everything until you can't
- expect obsolescence, so save long-lived artifacts if they'll be needed

## GitHub

- collaboration - share files, manage conflicts
- task management - list and discuss issues, link to code & changes
  - (waffle & trello - prioritize issues)
- code versioning - document changes, option to revert or checkout
- open research is possible
