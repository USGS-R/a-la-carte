## Introduction

What is `geoknife`?

</p>

* R-package to get climate data into R

The `geoknife` package was created to support web-based geoprocessing of large gridded datasets according to their overlap with landscape (or aquatic/ocean) features that are often irregularly shaped. geoknife creates data access and subsequent geoprocessing requests for the USGS's Geo Data Portal to carry out on a web server. 

`geoknife`: 
 
* allows the user to avoid downloading large datasets
* avoids reinventing the wheel for the creation and optimization of complex geoprocessing algorithms
* uses computing resources that are dedicated elsewhere, so geoknife operations do not have much of an impact on a local computer

## Overview


## NWIS Overview (US Geological Survey water data)

* Unit Data
    + "Real-time" data
    + Available data from 2007 (big improvement from 120 days!)
  
* Daily Data
    + Data aggregated from the unit data to a daily statistic
    + This data can go back many decades
    
* Discrete Data
    + Water quality data
    + Groundwater level
    + Rating curves
    + Surfacewater measurements
    
* Meta Data
    + Site information
    + Parameter information
